class TemporaryDirectory:
    """Temporary directory context manager for Medunda tools.

    This class provides a context manager for creating and managing temporary
    directories. It ensures that the directory is created upon entering the
    context and removed upon exiting.

    It is basically a wrapper around the built-in TemporaryDirectory class, but
    there are two main differences: the context manager returns a Path object
    instead of a string, and the directory is created inside the scratch dir
    if an environment variable SCRATCH is set.

    The idea of using a scratch directory is to avoid issues on clusters where
    the /tmp directory is not shared with all nodes (and it is usually very
    small). This class ensures that all the temporary directories are created
    inside a directory named `.medunda_temp` which is created inside the scratch
    directory.
